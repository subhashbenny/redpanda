            <h1>Red Pandas</h1>
            <p>Almost 50 percent of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. The loss of nesting trees and
                bamboo is causing a decline
                in red panda populations across much of their range because their forest home is being cleared.</p>

            <p>
                It might seem like an oxymoron, but carnivore in this case doesn't mean meat eater.
                Carnivore is a biological order that includes groups like bears, dogs, and cats, and while these animals
                are generally carnivores, some are omnivores, and some are vegetarians.
                Red pandas are classified as carnivores because they're descended from the same ancestors as the other
                carnivores, but they rarely eat anything other than bamboo and a few insects. And while giant pandas eat
                all of a bamboo plant, red pandas eat only the young leaves. Because this is such a nutritionally poor
                food source, they need to spend 13 hours a day eating and looking for food and can lose upwards of 15
                percent of their body weight in winter.
            </p>
            <p>After the red panda was discovered in the 1820s, it was just called the panda (the origin of the name is
                controversial, but it probably comes from the Nepali word ponya, meaning "bamboo or plant eating
                animal"). Forty years later, Europeans found a new animal in China and called it the Parti-Colored
                bear—because unlike polar bears, black bears, or brown bears it was multi-colored.</p>
